		<p>Computers have always fascinated me from an early age. I started to learn rudimentary concepts in high school like how loops work, how computers "think", and the various programming languages available.</p>
		<p>The first language I started learning was actually Batch. I would create simple calculators for games that I played as well as very simple text-based games.</p>
		<p>Even though they would sometimes takes hours to make, and looking back on it - really shouldn't have; the end product was always satisfying to play around with knowing that I made it myself.</p>
		<p>So when it came time to choose a major for college - Computer Science seemed like the most obvious choice for me. It's a decision I will never regret - I've enjoyed every class I've taken even though they may have been difficult. 
		<p>As for the future, I'm more than excited to start my journey into Software Development with Travelers. I still have much to learn, there's no doubt about that, but I think I'm ready for the challenge. Whether it be Java, Python, C++, etc., I'm just happy to be doing what I love, and I'm thankful for the opportunity.</p>

		<div class="aboutleft">
		<hr>
		<p>I've always wanted to create my website. Ever since high school when many a websites were created using <a href="https://www.wix.com/">Wix</a> and <a href="https://www.weebly.com/">Weebly.</a> for various class projects or my own experimentation.</p> 
		<p>Towards the end of high school, every student was required to create their own e-portfolio and present it to a teacher to graduate. This was done through some type of on-line website builder. You can find more information on <a href="http://www.coventrypublicschools.org/schools/chs/e-porfolio">this</a> page if you wish.</p>
		<p>Well, I'm pretty sure <a href="https://www.weebly.com/">Weebly</a> (the service I most likely would have used) shuts down websites after a period of inactivity from the admin of the site so mine is long gone. So I guess you could say this site it sort of a tribute.</p>
		<p>I also just thought the idea of having my own personal website would be neat and - even though I already have a job lined up after graduation - would be a nice addition to my resume, or at the very least a good talking point during an interview.</p>
		<p>Additionally, as part of my CSC 215 - Intro to Web Development course, I've created this as my final project.</p>

		<div class="aboutleft">
		<hr>
		<p>As I gain experience and my resume expands, I'll continually update the site with new information.</p>
		<p>In addition to this, if you have any suggestions for the site or want to get in contact with me, please use the <a href="contact.html">contact</a> page to get in touch. </p>
