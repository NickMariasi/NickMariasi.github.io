		<p>Computers have always fascinated me from an early age. I started to learn rudimentary concepts in high school like how loops work, how computers "think", and the various programming languages available.</p>
		<p>The first language I started learning was actually Batch. I would create simple calculators for games that I played as well as very simple text-based games.</p>
		<p>Even though they would sometimes takes hours to make, and looking back on it - really shouldn't have; the end product was always satisfying to play around with knowing that I made it myself.</p>
		<p>So when it came time to choose a major for college - Computer Science seemed like the most obvious choice for me. It's a decision I will never regret - I've enjoyed every class I've taken even though they may have been difficult. 
		<p>As for the future, I'm more than excited to start my journey into Software Development with Travelers. I still have much to learn, there's no doubt about that, but I think I'm ready for the challenge. Whether it be Java, Python, C++, etc., I'm just happy to be doing what I love, and I'm thankful for the opportunity.</p>

		<div class="aboutleft">
		<hr>
		<p>I've always wanted to create my website. Ever since high school when many a websites were created using <a href="https://www.wix.com/">Wix</a> and <a href="https://www.weebly.com/">Weebly.</a> for various class projects or my own experimentation.</p> 
		<p>Towards the end of high school, every student was required to create their own e-portfolio and present it to a teacher to graduate. This was done through some type of on-line website builder. You can find more information on <a href="http://www.coventrypublicschools.org/schools/chs/e-porfolio">this</a> page if you wish.</p>
		<p>Well, I'm pretty sure <a href="https://www.weebly.com/">Weebly</a> (the service I most likely would have used) shuts down websites after a period of inactivity from the admin of the site so mine is long gone. So I guess you could say this site it sort of a tribute.</p>
		<p>I also just thought the idea of having my own personal website would be neat and - even though I already have a job lined up after graduation - would be a nice addition to my resume, or at the very least a good talking point during an interview.</p>
		<p>Additionally, as part of my CSC 215 - Intro to Web Development course, I've created this as my final project.</p>

		<div class="parallax7"><h2 class="centeredtextbig">Future of this website</h2></div>
		<div class="aboutleft">
		<hr>
		<p>As I gain experience and my resume expands, I'll continually update the site with new information.</p>
		<p>As of now, the website is hosted through <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, a really neat and convenient way to host a website for something like a portfolio. My teacher used a github pages site to host the class syllabus, presentations, and homework assignments for three of his classes and after using the service myself, I can see why. Originally, I bought hosting through <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/">GoDaddy</a> (their lowest package) and the site speeds were so slow it was almost unusable. GitHub pages is far faster though -- and it's free. As for the domain, that was purchased through GoDaddy and even though there was some issues getting the CNAME to be added to the domains DNS settings, it worked in the end as evident through this pages URL.</p>
		<p>One caveat to using GitHub pages though is that it only serves static content and therefore there is no way to run the PHP necessary for the contact page to work. Because of this, you might have noticed that if you go to the contact page, you're brought to a different website. That's because I used <a href="https://x10hosting.com/">x10hosting</a> to hold the contact page and PHP file necessary to email me the results. All in all, it was a real headache to set up and while I could spend more money to get faster speeds on GoDaddy, the prices were a bit steep for what I wanted the site for. If you have any suggestions on web hosting services that are inexpensive yet quick, I would appreciate if you could let me know through the <a href="http://nickmariasi.x10host.com/contact.html">Contact</a> page.</p>
		<p>In addition to this, if you have any suggestions for the site or want to get in contact with me for any other reason, please use the <a href="http://nickmariasi.x10host.com/contact.html">contact</a> page to get in touch. </p>
